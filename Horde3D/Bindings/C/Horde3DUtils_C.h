/*	Topic: Introduction
		Some words about the Utility Library.
	
	Horde3D has a simple core API which offers all the functionality needed to control the engine. The
	engine core is intended to be as generic as possible to make the complete system lightweight and clean.
	Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to have more specific functions in order to increase productivity.
	For this reason the Utility Library is offered. It has some very handy functions that can help
	to make your life easier.

	relative to the content directory.
	
	Parameters:
		type  - type of resource
		
	Returns:
		pointer to the search path string

		as separator. All resource names are directly converted to filenames and the function tries to
		find them in the specified directories using the given order of the search paths.

		-32'767 and 1.0f to +32'767.
	
	Parameters:

		bitangentData      - bitangents xyz (required if tangents specified, otherwise NULL)
		texData1           - first texture coordinate uv set (optional, can be NULL)
		texData2           - second texture coordinate uv set (optional, can be NULL)
		
	Returns:

								   float *texData1, float *texData2 );

/* Function: h3dutCreateTGAImage
		Creates a TGA image in memory.
	
	Details:
		This utility function allocates memory at the pointer outData and creates a TGA image from the
		specified pixel data. The dimensions of the image have to be specified as well as the bit depth.
		The created TGA-image-data can be used as Texture2D or TexureCube resource in the engine.
		
		*Note: The memory allocated by this routine has to freed manually using the freeMem function.*
	
	Parameters:
		pixels   - pointer to pixel source data in BGR(A) format from which TGA-image is constructed;
		           memory layout: pixel with position (x, y) in image (origin of image is lower left
		           corner) has memory location (y * width + x) * (bpp / 8) in pixels array
		width    - width of source image
		height   - height of source image
		bpp      - color bit depth of source data (valid values: 24, 32)
		outData  - address of a pointer to which the address of the created memory block is written
		outSize  - variable to which to size of the created memory block is written
		
	Returns:
		false if at least one resource could not be loaded, otherwise true
